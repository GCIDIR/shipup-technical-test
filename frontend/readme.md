# Shipup Frontend Challenge
==================================

The technical test cosists of a coding test and a few follow-up questions.

Once complete please send a zip file containing two folders. One with all the code required to run you solution and the other with the answers to the questions as a PDF.

## Code Test

We need a simple two page website to display the current Weather in Paris using the Open Weather API (http://openweathermap.org/api). One page will be called 'Weather' and the other page called 'Sunrise/Sunset'.

### Inputs

User should be able to select the displayed units (Imperial or Metric system):

- Units
  - Imperial or Metric

### Output

- Weather Page
  - Current Date/Time
  - Current Temperature in selected unit
  - Current Weather Description
  - Current Wind Speed in selected unit
- Sunrise/set Page
  - Current Date/Time
  - Sunrise Time
  - Sunset Time

### Technical Requirements

- Requirements
  - React
  - Open Weather API (http://openweathermap.org/api)
  - Runs on modern browsers with no browser plugins required
- Flexibility On
  - Use of Redux (not mandatory)
  - Look/Feel
  - Browser Compatibilty
  - Libraries Used
  - User Interface
  - Language e.g. Javascript / Typescript / etc
  - Pretty much everything else!

### Level of Finish/Timescales

- Prototype
  - It doesn’t need to be complete, just demonstrate the concepts
- Approximate Timescale
  - It should be possible to rough up a prototype in 4 hours if everything goes smoothly, don’t worry about spending ages on it but let me know how long you did spend
  - Feel free to drop areas of functionality if they are a significant time drain, the aim is a prototype not a finished product

## Follow Up Questions

1. How long did you spend on the code test?
2. What went well?
3. Was there anything that was attempted but was not possible to get working in the time so is not visible in the code?
4. What would you do to improve it / continue development?
